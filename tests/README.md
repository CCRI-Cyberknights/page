# Testing Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive testing infrastructure for the CCRI Cyberknights Landing Pages project, including modern Playwright-based link testing, versioning diagnostics, and legacy testing systems for reference.

## üöÄ Modern Testing (2025 Best Practices)

### Playwright Link Testing

The project uses **Playwright** for fast, reliable link testing following 2025 best practices:

- **Ephemeral results** - No persistent logging, focus on actionable outcomes
- **Cross-browser testing** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari support
- **Performance monitoring** - Throughput and execution time tracking
- **Fail-fast approach** - Stop immediately on broken links
- **Clean console output** - Human-readable results for CI/CD

#### Available Commands

```bash
# Primary link testing (used by pre-commit hook)
npm run test:links

# Direct Playwright testing
npm run test:links:modern
npm run test:links:modern:debug
npm run test:links:modern:ui
```

#### Test Files

- **`playwright-link-testing-modern.spec.ts`** - Modern test suite with ephemeral results
- **`playwright-link-testing-comprehensive.spec.ts`** - Comprehensive test suite (legacy)
- **`playwright-link-testing.spec.ts`** - Feature parity verification tests

#### Performance

- **50% faster execution** (15s vs 30s+ for same links)
- **100% reduction in storage** (0KB vs 660KB legacy JSON)
- **3x browser coverage** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari vs Chrome only)

### Versioning Diagnostics

Comprehensive versioning pipeline validation using Playwright:

```bash
# Versioning diagnostics
npm run test:versioning
npm run test:versioning:debug
npm run test:versioning:ui
```

#### Test Files

- **`versioning-diagnostics.spec.ts`** - Comprehensive versioning pipeline validation

#### What It Tests

- **File System Verification** - `version.json`, `package.json` consistency
- **Git History Validation** - Release commits, version tags
- **Deployment Verification** - Live site version display
- **End-to-End Pipeline** - Complete versioning workflow

## üìö Legacy Testing Systems

### Selenium Link Testing (Preserved for Reference)

The original Selenium-based system is preserved for reference:

```bash
# Legacy Selenium testing
npm run test:links:selenium
```

#### Files

- **`scripts/test-links-dynamic-parallel.py`** - Original Selenium implementation
- **`selenium_env/`** - Python virtual environment with Selenium dependencies

#### Why It Was Replaced

- **Slower execution** (30+ seconds vs 15 seconds)
- **Single browser** (Chrome only vs Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Complex logging** (660KB JSON file with redundant data)
- **Maintenance overhead** (Python dependencies, virtual environment)

### Legacy JSON Logging (Removed)

The previous system stored test results in a massive JSON file:

- **`tested-links.json`** - 660KB file with 17,808 lines (removed)
- **`link_testing_logger.py`** - Python logger (removed)

#### Why It Was Removed

- **No actionable value** - Content hashing SPAs is meaningless
- **Performance impact** - JSON parsing on every test
- **Version control pollution** - Test results shouldn't be in git
- **Over-engineering** - Solving problems that don't exist

## üõ†Ô∏è Test Configuration

### Playwright Configuration

**`playwright.config.ts`** - Main Playwright configuration:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  reporter: [
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'tests/playwright-report' }],
    ['json', { outputFile: 'tests/test-results/versioning-results.json' }],
    ['list']
  ],
  use: {
    baseURL: 'https://ccri-cyberknights.github.io/page',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
    outputDir: 'tests/test-results',
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
    { name: 'firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
    { name: 'webkit', use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },
  ],
});
```

### Test Scripts

**`scripts/test-links-playwright.js`** - Node.js script for pre-commit integration:

- **Modern patterns** - Ephemeral results, performance monitoring
- **Clean output** - Human-readable console reporting
- **CI/CD integration** - Optimized for GitHub Actions

## üìä Test Results and Reporting

### Console Output

Modern tests provide clean, actionable console output:

```
üìä TEST RESULTS SUMMARY
========================
Total Links: 13
Passed: 13
Failed: 0
Success Rate: 100.0%
Duration: 14.12s
========================

‚ö° Performance: 13 links in 14.12s
üìä Throughput: 0.92 links/second
```

### HTML Reports

Playwright generates HTML reports in `tests/playwright-report/`:

```bash
# View latest report
npx playwright show-report tests/playwright-report
```

### CI/CD Integration

Tests are integrated with GitHub Actions:

- **Pre-commit hooks** - Automatic link testing on HTML changes
- **Versioning diagnostics** - Comprehensive pipeline validation
- **Artifact upload** - Test results uploaded on failures
- **PR comments** - Diagnostic summaries in pull requests

## üîß Development Workflow

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Quick link testing
npm run test:links

# Comprehensive testing with UI
npm run test:links:modern:ui

# Debug mode
npm run test:links:modern:debug

# Versioning diagnostics
npm run test:versioning
```

### Pre-commit Integration

The pre-commit hook automatically runs link tests when HTML files change:

```bash
# Pre-commit hook runs automatically
git commit -m "feat: add new page"

# Manual testing
npm run test:links
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

Tests run automatically in GitHub Actions:

- **On every push** - Link testing and versioning diagnostics
- **On pull requests** - Comprehensive validation
- **On releases** - Post-deployment verification

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked

- **Execution time** - Total test duration
- **Throughput** - Links tested per second
- **Success rate** - Percentage of passing tests
- **Browser coverage** - Cross-browser compatibility

### Optimization

- **Parallel execution** - Multiple browsers simultaneously
- **Timeout handling** - Graceful failure on slow responses
- **Resource management** - Efficient browser lifecycle
- **Cache utilization** - Playwright's built-in caching

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tests Timing Out
```bash
# Increase timeout
npx playwright test --timeout=60000
```

#### Browser Installation Issues
```bash
# Reinstall browsers
npx playwright install
```

#### Local Server Not Running
```bash
# Start local server
npm run dev
# Then run tests
npm run test:links
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Debug with UI
npm run test:links:modern:ui

# Debug with console
npm run test:links:modern:debug
```
