# Testing Strategy & Implementation

Modern testing using Playwright to ensure functionality across client-side routing, QR code generation, and cross-page navigation. The project uses Playwright for comprehensive end-to-end testing with better performance, reliability, and cross-browser support.

## CI/CD Pipeline Drift Prevention

### Overview

The project includes a comprehensive **CI/CD Pipeline Drift Prevention** system that prevents GitHub Actions workflows from referencing non-existent npm scripts. This system eliminates deployment failures caused by incomplete refactoring.

### Problem Solved

**Pipeline Drift** occurs when:
1. You refactor your `package.json` scripts (remove, rename, consolidate)
2. You update documentation and local usage
3. **But forget to update GitHub Actions workflows**
4. CI/CD fails with "Missing script" errors

### Validation Tools

#### 1. Main Validation Tool (`tests/ci-validation/validate-workflow-scripts.js`)

**Purpose**: Validates that all GitHub Actions workflows reference only existing npm scripts.

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Parses all `.yml`/`.yaml` workflow files
- ‚úÖ Extracts `npm run` commands from workflow steps
- ‚úÖ Cross-references with `package.json` scripts
- ‚úÖ Reports missing scripts with file locations
- ‚úÖ Warns about unused scripts
- ‚úÖ Exit codes for CI/CD integration

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run validation
node tests/ci-validation/validate-workflow-scripts.js

# Exit code 0 = success, 1 = validation failed
```

#### 2. Pre-commit Hook (`tests/ci-validation/pre-commit-validation.sh`)

**Purpose**: Automatically validates workflows before commits are allowed.

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Runs automatically on every commit
- ‚úÖ Blocks commits if workflows reference invalid scripts
- ‚úÖ Provides helpful error messages and fix suggestions
- ‚úÖ Installs required dependencies automatically
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of missing directories

**Integration**:
```bash
# Add to .husky/pre-commit
bash tests/ci-validation/pre-commit-validation.sh
```

### Prevention Strategy

#### 1. **Immediate Prevention**
- Pre-commit hook blocks commits with invalid workflow references
- Fast feedback loop prevents broken workflows from reaching main branch

#### 2. **CI/CD Validation**
- Workflow validation step catches any remaining issues
- Fails fast with clear error messages

#### 3. **Refactoring Process**
When refactoring scripts:
1. ‚úÖ Update `package.json`
2. ‚úÖ Run `node tests/ci-validation/validate-workflow-scripts.js`
3. ‚úÖ Fix any workflow references
4. ‚úÖ Update documentation
5. ‚úÖ Commit changes

#### 4. **Monitoring**
- Regular validation runs catch drift early
- Unused script warnings help clean up dead code
- Clear error messages make fixes easy

### Integration with Existing Testing

The CI/CD validation system integrates seamlessly with the existing Playwright testing suite:

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests (includes CI/CD validation)
npm run test:links

# Debug mode (includes CI/CD validation)
npm run test:debug

# CI/CD validation only
node tests/ci-validation/validate-workflow-scripts.js
```

## Overview

The project uses a comprehensive test suite to validate:
- Client-side hash-based routing (`#/page` navigation)
- QR Code functionality (generation, error correction, download)
- Resource page filtering and display
- Cross-page link functionality
- Standalone page navigation and features
- **Enhanced Error Detection**: Context-aware error detection that avoids false positives

**üìù Development Note**: All commits should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.) for proper version management - see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-conventions).

## Test Results Directory Structure

### Standardized Output Location

The project uses a standardized test results directory structure that follows industry best practices:

**‚úÖ Current Structure:**
```
/home/zachary/Cursor_Projects/page/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-results/                    # Test artifacts and output
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .last-run.json              # Playwright metadata
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ versioning-results.json     # JSON test reports
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [test-artifacts]/           # Screenshots, videos, traces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                          # Test source code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.spec.ts                   # Test files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ playwright-report/          # HTML test reports
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other project files]
```

**Benefits of Root-Level `./test-results/`:**
- **Industry Standard**: Aligns with Playwright's default behavior
- **Clean Separation**: Test source (`./tests/`) vs test output (`./test-results/`)
- **Easy Access**: Test artifacts immediately visible at project root
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Most CI systems expect test results at project root
- **Tool Compatibility**: Better compatibility with external tools and scripts

**Configuration:**
- **Playwright Config**: `outputDir: 'test-results'` in `playwright.config.ts`
- **Test Scripts**: Use `--output=test-results` flag
- **Test Files**: Screenshot paths use `../test-results/` (relative from tests directory)
- **Git Ignore**: `test-results/` is properly ignored

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:links:playwright
```

## Best Practices

### Test Reliability

**1. Stable Selectors**: Use IDs and data attributes over CSS classes
**2. Proper Waits**: Always wait for elements to be present/visible
**3. Clean State**: Reset browser state between tests
**4. Error Handling**: Implement proper try/catch blocks

### Performance

**1. Headless Mode**: Use headless browsers for faster execution
**2. Parallel Execution**: Run independent tests in parallel
**3. Resource Cleanup**: Always close browser instances
**4. Selective Testing**: Run only relevant tests during development

### Maintenance

**1. Regular Updates**: Keep Playwright and browser versions current
**2. Test Review**: Regularly review and update test cases
**3. Documentation**: Keep test documentation current
**4. Monitoring**: Track test execution times and failure rates

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

**2. Performance Testing**: Measure page load times and interaction responsiveness
**3. Accessibility Testing**: Integrate aXe-core for accessibility validation
**4. QR Code Modal Testing**: Add comprehensive QR code modal functionality tests

### Test Coverage Expansion

**1. Calendar Functionality**: Test Google Calendar integration and ICS parsing
**2. Resource Filtering**: Test all resource categories and search functionality
**3. QR Code Edge Cases**: Test with various URL lengths and special characters
**4. Cross-Browser Testing**: Add Firefox and Safari support

## Troubleshooting

### Timeout Protection

**Critical**: Always use timeout protection to prevent hanging tests:

```bash
# Standard timeout for development testing
timeout 30s npx playwright test

# Specific test with timeout
timeout 30s npx playwright test tests/blog-hashtag-functionality.spec.ts --project=chromium

# NPM scripts with timeout (preferred)
npm run test:timeout          # All tests with 30s timeout
npm run test:timeout:single   # Single test with grep filter
npm run test:hashtags         # Hashtag tests with timeout
```

**Timeout Guidelines:**
- **30 seconds**: Standard timeout for integration tests (recommended)
- **10 seconds**: Quick unit tests or simple functionality
- **60 seconds**: Complex browser automation tests
- **120 seconds**: Comprehensive test suites with multiple browsers

### Common Issues

**1. Element Not Found**: Check if element exists and is visible
**2. Timeout Errors**: Increase wait times for slow-loading content
**3. Port Conflicts**: Verify port 8000 is available for the test server
**4. Browser Issues**: Ensure Playwright browsers are installed (`npx playwright install`)

### Debug Commands

**Check Playwright Installation**:
```bash
npx playwright --version
```

**Install Playwright Browsers**:
```bash
npx playwright install
```

**Test Server Status**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000
```

## Link Testing System

### Comprehensive Testing System (Current)

The project uses **Playwright** for comprehensive testing with modern patterns and cross-browser support.

**Key Features:**
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Links + version display testing
- **Faster execution**: 3-5x faster than previous testing approaches
- **Better error handling**: Comprehensive timeouts and graceful fallbacks
- **Cross-browser support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari testing
- **SPA navigation**: Built-in support for single-page application routing
- **Modern API**: Cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Ephemeral results**: No persistent logging, focus on actionable outcomes

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Run comprehensive testing (links + version display)
npm run test:links

# Debug mode with visible browser
npm run test:debug

# Interactive UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

**Pre-commit Integration:**
Tests automatically run in the pre-commit hook when HTML or JavaScript files are modified, ensuring all functionality works before commits.

### Dual URL Testing
The system tests both production (`https://ccri-cyberknights.github.io/page`) and local development (`http://localhost:8000`) URLs to ensure links work correctly in all environments. Pre-commit hooks automatically test both URLs when HTML files change, blocking commits if broken links are detected.

### Dynamic Discovery
Uses HTML parsing to find all `<a>` tags, supports both internal hash routes (`#/page`) and external URLs, and includes comprehensive error detection with context-aware logic to avoid false positives from legitimate content.

## Testing Strategy Roadmap
