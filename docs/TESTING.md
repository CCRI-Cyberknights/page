**For troubleshooting layout issues and CSS changes:** See [Advanced Screenshot Analysis & AI-Powered Debugging](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#advanced-screenshot-analysis--ai-powered-debugging) in the troubleshooting guide.

## CI/CD Pipeline Drift Prevention

### Overview

The project includes a comprehensive **CI/CD Pipeline Drift Prevention** system that prevents GitHub Actions workflows from referencing non-existent npm scripts. This system eliminates deployment failures caused by incomplete refactoring.

### Problem Solved

**Pipeline Drift** occurs when:
1. You refactor your `package.json` scripts (remove, rename, consolidate)
2. You update documentation and local usage
3. **But forget to update GitHub Actions workflows**
4. CI/CD fails with "Missing script" errors

### Validation Tools

#### 1. Main Validation Tool (`tests/ci-validation/validate-workflow-scripts.js`)

**Purpose**: Validates that all GitHub Actions workflows reference only existing npm scripts.

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Parses all `.yml`/`.yaml` workflow files
- ‚úÖ Extracts `npm run` commands from workflow steps
- ‚úÖ Cross-references with `package.json` scripts
- ‚úÖ Reports missing scripts with file locations
- ‚úÖ Warns about unused scripts
- ‚úÖ Exit codes for CI/CD integration

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run validation
node tests/ci-validation/validate-workflow-scripts.js

# Exit code 0 = success, 1 = validation failed
```

#### 2. Pre-commit Hook (`tests/ci-validation/pre-commit-validation.sh`)

**Purpose**: Automatically validates workflows before commits are allowed.

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Runs automatically on every commit
- ‚úÖ Blocks commits if workflows reference invalid scripts
- ‚úÖ Provides helpful error messages and fix suggestions
- ‚úÖ Installs required dependencies automatically
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of missing directories

**Integration**:
```bash
# Add to .husky/pre-commit
bash tests/ci-validation/pre-commit-validation.sh
```

### Prevention Strategy

#### 1. **Immediate Prevention**
- Pre-commit hook blocks commits with invalid workflow references
- Fast feedback loop prevents broken workflows from reaching main branch

#### 2. **CI/CD Validation**
- Workflow validation step catches any remaining issues
- Fails fast with clear error messages

#### 3. **Refactoring Process**
When refactoring scripts:
1. ‚úÖ Update `package.json`
2. ‚úÖ Run `node tests/ci-validation/validate-workflow-scripts.js`
3. ‚úÖ Fix any workflow references
4. ‚úÖ Update documentation
5. ‚úÖ Commit changes

#### 4. **Monitoring**
- Regular validation runs catch drift early
- Unused script warnings help clean up dead code
- Clear error messages make fixes easy

### Integration with Existing Testing

The CI/CD validation system integrates seamlessly with the existing Playwright testing suite:

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests (includes CI/CD validation)
npm run test:links

# Debug mode (includes CI/CD validation)
npm run test:debug

# CI/CD validation only
node tests/ci-validation/validate-workflow-scripts.js
```

### Documentation

For complete details on the CI/CD validation system, see:
- **`tests/ci-validation/README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation and usage guide
- **`tests/ci-validation/validate-workflow-scripts.js`** - Main validation tool
- **`tests/ci-validation/pre-commit-validation.sh`** - Pre-commit hook script

## Overview

The project uses a comprehensive test suite to validate:
- Client-side hash-based routing (`#/page` navigation)
- QR Code functionality (generation, error correction, download)
- Resource page filtering and display
- Cross-page link functionality
- Standalone page navigation and features
- **Enhanced Error Detection**: Context-aware error detection that avoids false positives
- **HTTP Status Validation**: Basic HTTP status code checking for navigation requests

**üìù Development Note**: All commits should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.) for proper version management - see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-conventions).

## Test Results Directory Structure

### Standardized Output Location

The project uses a standardized test results directory structure that follows industry best practices:

**‚úÖ Current Structure:**
```
/home/zachary/Cursor_Projects/page/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-results/                    # Test artifacts and output
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .last-run.json              # Playwright metadata
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ versioning-results.json     # JSON test reports
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [test-artifacts]/           # Screenshots, videos, traces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                          # Test source code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.spec.ts                   # Test files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ playwright-report/          # HTML test reports
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other project files]
```

**Benefits of Root-Level `./test-results/`:**
- **Industry Standard**: Aligns with Playwright's default behavior
- **Clean Separation**: Test source (`./tests/`) vs test output (`./test-results/`)
- **Easy Access**: Test artifacts immediately visible at project root
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Most CI systems expect test results at project root
- **Tool Compatibility**: Better compatibility with external tools and scripts

**Configuration:**
- **Playwright Config**: `outputDir: 'test-results'` in `playwright.config.ts`
- **Test Scripts**: Use `--output=test-results` flag
- **Test Files**: Screenshot paths use `../test-results/` (relative from tests directory)
- **Git Ignore**: `test-results/` is properly ignored

## Test Architecture

### Test Environment
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (cross-browser testing)
- **Framework**: Playwright (modern, fast, reliable)
- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript

## Responsive Design Testing Patterns

### Viewport-Specific Testing Strategy

The project implements comprehensive responsive design testing using predefined viewport definitions and targeted test suites.

#### Viewport Definitions (`tests/helpers/viewports.ts`)

```typescript
export const viewports = {
  // Desktop viewports
  desktop: { width: 1867, height: 963 },
  laptop: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
  smallLaptop: { width: 1024, height: 624 }, // ‚≠ê Key responsive breakpoint
  
  // Tablet viewports  
  tablet: { width: 768, height: 1024 },
  
  // Mobile viewports
  pixel7a: { width: 414, height: 794 },
  iphone13: { width: 390, height: 844 },
  pixel5: { width: 393, height: 851 },
  smallAndroid: { width: 360, height: 740 },
};
```

#### Declarative Panel Visibility System

The project implements a **comprehensive declarative panel visibility system** that follows responsive design best practices with systematic testing coverage.

**Panel Visibility Matrix:**
```javascript
const PANEL_VISIBILITY_MATRIX = {
  'mobile-portrait': { width: 375, height: 667, panels: { display: true, input: true, advanced: false } },
  'mobile-landscape': { width: 667, height: 375, panels: { display: true, input: true, advanced: false } },
  'tablet-portrait': { width: 768, height: 1024, panels: { display: true, input: true, advanced: true } },
  'laptop-constrained': { width: 1024, height: 624, panels: { display: true, input: true, advanced: false } },
  'desktop-standard': { width: 1920, height: 1080, panels: { display: true, input: true, advanced: true } }
};
```

**CSS Custom Properties (Single Source of Truth):**
```css
:root {
  --breakpoint-mobile: 480px;      /* Mobile devices */
  --breakpoint-tablet: 768px;      /* Tablets and small laptops */
  --breakpoint-desktop: 1024px;    /* Desktop and large tablets */
  --breakpoint-large: 1280px;      /* Large desktops */
  --height-constrained: 650px;     /* Hide advanced controls */
}
```

**Declarative Media Queries:**
```css
/* Mobile viewports - Hide advanced controls */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  .qr-fullscreen [data-qr-panel="advanced"] {
    display: none !important;
  }
}

/* Constrained viewports - Hide advanced controls */
@media (max-width: 1024px) and (max-height: 650px) {
  .qr-fullscreen [data-qr-panel="advanced"] {
    display: none !important;
  }
}
```

**JavaScript Breakpoint Detection:**
```javascript
// Centralized breakpoint detection
const breakpoint = qrManager.getBreakpoint();
// Returns: { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop, isLargeDesktop, isConstrained }
```

## Mobile Keyboard Visibility Testing

### Overview

The project includes comprehensive testing for mobile keyboard behavior using Playwright automation to ensure that both QR codes and input fields remain visible when the mobile keyboard appears across different devices.

### Test Files

- **`tests/qr-modal-mobile-keyboard-playwright.spec.ts`** - Playwright-native mobile keyboard tests
- **`scripts/test-mobile-keyboard-playwright.sh`** - Automated test runner using only Playwright

**Legacy Files (Advanced):**
- **`tests/qr-modal-mobile-keyboard-visibility.spec.ts`** - Basic keyboard visibility tests across devices
- **`tests/qr-modal-keyboard-opencv-analysis.spec.ts`** - Advanced tests with OpenCV analysis
- **`scripts/analyze-keyboard-visibility.py`** - OpenCV script for screenshot analysis
- **`scripts/test-keyboard-visibility.sh`** - Automated test runner with OpenCV

### Device Coverage

Tests cover multiple device types:

```typescript
const MOBILE_DEVICES = {
  'iPhone SE': { width: 375, height: 667, pixelRatio: 2 },
  'iPhone 12': { width: 390, height: 844, pixelRatio: 3 },
  'iPhone 12 Pro Max': { width: 428, height: 926, pixelRatio: 3 },
  'Pixel 5': { width: 393, height: 851, pixelRatio: 2.75 },
  'Pixel 7': { width: 412, height: 915, pixelRatio: 2.625 },
  'Samsung Galaxy S21': { width: 384, height: 854, pixelRatio: 3 },
  'iPad Mini': { width: 768, height: 1024, pixelRatio: 2 },
  'iPad Pro': { width: 1024, height: 1366, pixelRatio: 2 }
};
```

### Keyboard Simulation

Tests simulate keyboard appearance by:

1. **Focusing on input fields** to trigger real keyboard
2. **Using actual mobile device emulation** with Playwright
3. **Testing real keyboard behavior** across different devices

```typescript
// Real keyboard simulation
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 }); // iPhone SE
await page.click('[data-qr-panel="input"] input');
await page.waitForTimeout(2000); // Wait for keyboard animation

// Verify elements remain visible
await expect(page.locator('[data-qr-panel="display"]')).toBeVisible();
await expect(page.locator('[data-qr-panel="input"] input')).toBeVisible();
```

### Implementation Approach

The solution uses a **simple, elegant approach**:

- **CSS `100dvh`**: Automatically handles viewport changes when keyboard appears
- **`interactive-widget=resizes-content`**: Meta tag tells browser how to handle keyboard
- **Simple resize detection**: JavaScript only recalculates QR code size when needed
- **No complex APIs**: Avoids over-engineered `visualViewport` API solutions

### Running Keyboard Tests

**Recommended (Playwright Native):**
```bash
# Run mobile keyboard tests using only Playwright
./scripts/test-mobile-keyboard-playwright.sh

# Run specific test
npx playwright test tests/qr-modal-mobile-keyboard-playwright.spec.ts
```

**Advanced (With OpenCV):**
```bash
# Run all keyboard visibility tests with OpenCV analysis
./scripts/test-keyboard-visibility.sh

# Run specific test
npx playwright test tests/qr-modal-keyboard-opencv-analysis.spec.ts

# Manual OpenCV analysis
python3 scripts/analyze-keyboard-visibility.py before.png after.png
```

### Test Assertions

Tests verify:

- ‚úÖ **QR Code Visibility**: QR code remains fully visible and properly sized
- ‚úÖ **Input Accessibility**: Input field remains accessible and functional
- ‚úÖ **Modal Adaptation**: Modal layout adapts correctly to keyboard
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Works across iOS and Android devices
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Controls**: Hidden on mobile viewports (as intended)

### Expected Results

For successful keyboard visibility:

- **QR Code**: Fully visible, properly sized for available space
- **Input Field**: Accessible and functional above keyboard
- **Modal Layout**: Adapts correctly using CSS `100dvh` and meta tag
- **Advanced Controls**: Hidden on mobile (‚â§768px width)
- **Overall Status**: All elements visible and functional

#### Responsive Testing Patterns

**1. Cross-Viewport Validation**
```typescript
// Test behavior across all viewport sizes
for (const [device, viewport] of Object.entries(viewports)) {
  test.describe(`${device} (${viewport.width}√ó${viewport.height})`, () => {
    test('component adapts correctly', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.setViewportSize(viewport);
      // ... test implementation
    });
  });
}
```

**2. Breakpoint-Specific Testing**
```typescript
// Test specific responsive breakpoints
const responsiveBreakpoints = [
  { name: 'Desktop', viewport: { width: 1867, height: 963 } },
  { name: 'SmallLaptop', viewport: { width: 1024, height: 624 } },
  { name: 'Mobile', viewport: { width: 414, height: 794 } }
];
```

**3. QR Modal Responsive Behavior**
- **Desktop (>1024px)**: Full feature set with all controls
- **Small Laptop (‚â§1024px, ‚â§700px)**: Simplified content (QR + URL only)
- **Mobile (‚â§768px)**: Touch-optimized layout with hidden advanced controls

#### Test Coverage Matrix

| Component | Desktop | Small Laptop | Tablet | Mobile |
|-----------|---------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Navigation | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Responsive | ‚úÖ Hamburger |
| QR Modal | ‚úÖ All Controls | ‚úÖ Simplified | ‚úÖ Simplified | ‚úÖ Touch-Optimized |
| Footer | ‚úÖ Standard | ‚úÖ Standard | ‚úÖ Standard | ‚úÖ Compact |
| Content Layout | ‚úÖ Multi-Column | ‚úÖ Single Column | ‚úÖ Single Column | ‚úÖ Single Column |

        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:links:playwright
```

## Best Practices

### Test Reliability

**1. Stable Selectors**: Use IDs and data attributes over CSS classes
**2. Proper Waits**: Always wait for elements to be present/visible
**3. Clean State**: Reset browser state between tests
**4. Error Handling**: Implement proper try/catch blocks

### Performance

**1. Headless Mode**: Use headless browsers for faster execution
**2. Parallel Execution**: Run independent tests in parallel
**3. Resource Cleanup**: Always close browser instances
**4. Selective Testing**: Run only relevant tests during development

### Maintenance

**1. Regular Updates**: Keep Playwright and browser versions current
**2. Test Review**: Regularly review and update test cases
**3. Documentation**: Keep test documentation current
**4. Monitoring**: Track test execution times and failure rates

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

**1. Visual Regression Testing**: Add screenshot comparison tests
**2. Performance Testing**: Measure page load times and interaction responsiveness
**3. Accessibility Testing**: Integrate aXe-core for accessibility validation
**4. QR Code Modal Testing**: Add comprehensive QR code modal functionality tests

### Test Coverage Expansion

**1. Calendar Functionality**: Test Google Calendar integration and ICS parsing
**2. Resource Filtering**: Test all resource categories and search functionality
**3. QR Code Edge Cases**: Test with various URL lengths and special characters
**4. Cross-Browser Testing**: Add Firefox and Safari support

## Troubleshooting

### Timeout Protection

**Critical**: Always use timeout protection to prevent hanging tests:

```bash
# Standard timeout for development testing
timeout 30s npx playwright test

# Specific test with timeout
timeout 30s npx playwright test tests/blog-hashtag-functionality.spec.ts --project=chromium

# NPM scripts with timeout (preferred)
npm run test:timeout          # All tests with 30s timeout
npm run test:timeout:single   # Single test with grep filter
npm run test:hashtags         # Hashtag tests with timeout
```

**Timeout Guidelines:**
- **30 seconds**: Standard timeout for integration tests (recommended)
- **10 seconds**: Quick unit tests or simple functionality
- **60 seconds**: Complex browser automation tests
- **120 seconds**: Comprehensive test suites with multiple browsers

### Common Issues

**1. Element Not Found**: Check if element exists and is visible
**2. Timeout Errors**: Increase wait times for slow-loading content
**3. Port Conflicts**: Verify port 8000 is available for the test server
**4. Browser Issues**: Ensure Playwright browsers are installed (`npx playwright install`)

### Debug Commands

**Check Playwright Installation**:
```bash
npx playwright --version
```

**Install Playwright Browsers**:
```bash
npx playwright install
```

**Test Server Status**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000
```

## Link Testing System

### Comprehensive Testing System (Current)

The project uses **Playwright** for comprehensive testing with modern patterns and cross-browser support.

**Key Features:**
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Links + version display testing
- **Faster execution**: 3-5x faster than previous testing approaches
- **Better error handling**: Comprehensive timeouts and graceful fallbacks
- **Cross-browser support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari testing
- **SPA navigation**: Built-in support for single-page application routing
- **Modern API**: Cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Ephemeral results**: No persistent logging, focus on actionable outcomes

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Run comprehensive testing (links + version display)
npm run test:links

# Debug mode with visible browser
npm run test:debug

# Interactive UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

**Pre-commit Integration:**
Tests automatically run in the pre-commit hook when HTML or JavaScript files are modified, ensuring all functionality works before commits.

### Dual URL Testing
The system tests both production (`https://ccri-cyberknights.github.io/page`) and local development (`http://localhost:8000`) URLs to ensure links work correctly in all environments. Pre-commit hooks automatically test both URLs when HTML files change, blocking commits if broken links are detected.

### Dynamic Discovery
Uses HTML parsing to find all `<a>` tags, supports both internal hash routes (`#/page`) and external URLs, and includes comprehensive error detection with context-aware logic to avoid false positives from legitimate content.

## Testing Strategy Roadmap

### Overview
The project has a comprehensive testing roadmap with aspirational goals for future enhancements. Phase 1 improvements (context-aware error detection, HTTP status validation, legitimate content whitelist) are already implemented. Future phases include DOM-based validation, advanced SPA testing patterns, tool migration to Playwright, and analytics integration.

### Current Capabilities
- **Playwright link testing** with comprehensive coverage
- Hash-based routing validation for SPAs
- Dynamic content discovery and testing
- Environment-specific testing (localhost vs production)
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting
- Cross-browser testing support

### Future Enhancements (Phases 2-5)
- **Phase 2**: DOM-based validation with element presence checks and content validation
- **Phase 3**: Advanced SPA testing patterns with state management and performance testing
- **Phase 4**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Tool migration to Playwright for better reliability and performance
- **Phase 5**: Analytics integration with test result tracking and trend analysis

## Selenium Migration History

### Migration to Playwright (2025)

The project successfully migrated from Selenium WebDriver to Playwright-based testing in September 2025. This migration eliminated technical debt and modernized the testing infrastructure.

#### Migration Benefits Achieved
- **3-5x Faster**: Significant performance improvements over Selenium
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari testing
- **Better Reliability**: More stable browser automation
- **Ephemeral Results**: No persistent logging, focus on actionable outcomes
- **Modern Tooling**: TypeScript support, better debugging capabilities
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single language (JavaScript/TypeScript) instead of Python

#### Migration Execution
The migration was executed as an **immediate cutover** approach:
- **Single execution session**: All Selenium infrastructure removed at once
- **Complete elimination**: Python virtual environment, test files, and scripts removed
- **Zero intermediate states**: No dual-system complexity to maintain
- **Immediate benefits**: Full performance gains from day one

#### Files Removed During Migration
- **Python Virtual Environment**: `selenium_env/` (~50MB+)
- **Python Test Files** (8 files): All Selenium-based tests
- **Python Scripts** (1 file): `test-links-dynamic-parallel.py` (Selenium-based link testing)
- **Configuration References**: Selenium scripts from `package.json` and `.gitignore`

#### Migration Validation
- **All Playwright tests passing**: 100% success rate
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari verified
- **CI/CD pipeline stable**: GitHub Actions using Playwright
- **Performance validated**: 0.91-0.96 links/second throughput
