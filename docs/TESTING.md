**Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Playwright ensures functionality works across different browsers and environments (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

**User Journey Testing**: Tests simulate real user interactions (clicks, navigation, form input).

**Visual Regression Prevention**: Catches layout and styling issues that unit tests might miss.

### Test Design Principles

**1. Real User Simulation**
- Tests interact with elements as users would
- Use realistic wait times and interaction patterns
- Test complete user journeys, not isolated functions

**2. Robust Element Selection**
- Prefer stable selectors (IDs, data attributes)
- Use XPath for complex text-based selections
- Implement proper wait strategies (WebDriverWait)

**3. Isolated Test Cases**
- Each test can run independently
- No shared state between tests
- Clean setup and teardown

**4. Comprehensive Coverage**
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Validate error states and fallbacks
- Cover all major user workflows

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

### Test Execution

**Run All Tests**:
```bash
npm run test:links:playwright
```

**Run Individual Tests**:

test('feature name', async ({ page }) => {
  // Setup
  await page.goto('http://localhost:8000/page');
  
  // Test steps
  await page.click('#element');
  
  // Assertions
  await expect(page.locator('#result')).toBeVisible();
});
```

**3. Update Documentation**:
- Add test description to `tests/README.md`
- Update test coverage list

```

## Link Testing System

### Comprehensive Testing System (Current)

The project uses **Playwright** for comprehensive testing with modern patterns and cross-browser support.

**Key Features:**
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Links + version display testing
- **Faster execution**: 3-5x faster than previous testing approaches
- **Better error handling**: Comprehensive timeouts and graceful fallbacks
- **Cross-browser support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari testing
- **SPA navigation**: Built-in support for single-page application routing
- **Modern API**: Cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Ephemeral results**: No persistent logging, focus on actionable outcomes

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Run comprehensive testing (links + version display)
npm run test:links

# Debug mode with visible browser
npm run test:debug

# Interactive UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

**Pre-commit Integration:**
Tests automatically run in the pre-commit hook when HTML or JavaScript files are modified, ensuring all functionality works before commits.

### Dual URL Testing
The system tests both production (`https://ccri-cyberknights.github.io/page`) and local development (`http://localhost:8000`) URLs to ensure links work correctly in all environments. Pre-commit hooks automatically test both URLs when HTML files change, blocking commits if broken links are detected.

### Dynamic Discovery
Uses HTML parsing to find all `<a>` tags, supports both internal hash routes (`#/page`) and external URLs, and includes comprehensive error detection with context-aware logic to avoid false positives from legitimate content.
