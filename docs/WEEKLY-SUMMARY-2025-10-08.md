# Weekly Development Summary
**Week Ending: October 8, 2025**  
**Sprint Focus: Design Systems, Code Quality, & Content Expansion**

## Work Completed

### QR Code System Standardization

- **SVG Dimension Correction**: Fixed critical sizing bug where QR codes displayed at 232×232px instead of 120×120px; corrected all cheatsheet files (6 QR codes total).

- **Comprehensive Standards Documentation**: Created `docs/QR-CODE-STANDARDS.md` with complete design specification (viewBox "0 0 23.2 23.2", #000000 fill, 120×120 display size, emerald green background).

- **Automated Validation Tools**: Built `scripts/validate_qr_standards.py` with batch validation, auto-fix capabilities, detailed error/warning reporting, and CI/CD integration readiness.

- **SVG Migration Scripts**: Enhanced `scripts/generate_qr_codes.py` and `scripts/update-cheatsheet-qr-to-svg.py` for correct dimension generation and replacement logic.

### Tailwind CSS Refactoring Initiative

- **Phase 1 - Foundation**: Created comprehensive `TAILWIND-IDIOMS.md` guide and `REFACTOR-PLAN.md`; defined complete color palette, animation system, and component patterns in `tailwind.config.js`; added custom utilities (neon, spark, spark-glow shadows).

- **Phase 2 & 2.5 - Specificity Fixes**: Eliminated !important declarations by replacing `text-slate-300` utility classes with inline styles (`style="color: #cbd5e1;"`) across all blog posts (46 instances) and guide files (42 instances); ensures `.emphasis-text` color (--ember-spark) displays correctly.

- **Baseline Testing Infrastructure**: Created `tests/baseline-functionality.spec.ts` with 285 lines of regression prevention tests covering navigation, resources, blogs, search, and mobile responsiveness.

- **Migration Preparation**: Established 5-phase approach to reduce ~400 lines of custom CSS; documented decision points, risks, and DRY component patterns.

### Blog System Enhancements

- **Clickable Hashtags Feature**: Implemented automatic hashtag-to-link conversion in blog posts; created `#/search?q=term` endpoint; integrated with resource search functionality; proper URL encoding for special characters.

- **Critical Search Bug Fix**: Resolved broken `#/search?q=term` URLs by adding single line `app.innerHTML = routes['resources'];` to `renderResourcesPage()`; enhanced search to include resource descriptions/summaries.

- **Homepage Content Refinement**: Enhanced CCRI Cyber Club branding for authenticity; improved inclusivity messaging; streamlined content by removing unverified event/company references.

- **Blog Section Optimization**: Balanced blog prominence with amber styling positioned after main content; simplified implementation by removing dynamic loading; strategic placement for visual hierarchy.

- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind-based responsive layouts
- **QR Code Integration**: SVG QR codes (120×120px) with emerald backgrounds where applicable
- **Metadata Integration**: Complete JSON metadata for search, categorization, and routing

### Documentation Expansion

- **Design System Documentation**:
  - Created `docs/COLOR-PALETTE.md` (101 lines) with complete color system documentation
  - Created `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (123 lines) with debugging guides
  - Created `docs/UI.md` (114 lines) with UI architecture documentation
