# Content Architecture Evolution - v1.5.1

## Overview

This document outlines the content architecture refinements implemented in v1.5.1, focusing on strategic content organization, enhanced messaging, and improved user experience for QR code landing scenarios.

## Strategic Banner Placement

### Home Page Banner Restoration
- **Implementation**: "Excitement • Opportunity • Belonging" banner restored to home page only
- **Rationale**: QR code users land directly on the home page and need immediate value proposition
- **Design**: Full-width green banner with white text, positioned at top of page content
- **Scope**: Home page (`#/home`) only - other pages remain banner-free for cleaner navigation

### Banner Specifications
```html
<div class="w-full text-white text-sm tracking-wide mb-6" style="background-color: var(--primary-green);">
  <div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-3 flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-4 text-center">
    <span class="font-semibold">Excitement</span>
    <span>•</span>
    <span class="font-semibold">Opportunity</span>
    <span>•</span>
    <span class="font-semibold">Belonging</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Content Reorganization

### Career-Focused Messaging
- **Primary Change**: Moved "Career boost" content from Mission box to "Our Members Get Hired!" box
- **Rationale**: Logical grouping of career-related content for better user comprehension
- **Impact**: Creates dedicated career section with comprehensive value proposition

### Enhanced Hiring Messaging
- **New Copy**: "From resumes to real jobs — we help you land the role"
- **Supporting Details**:
  - "Build skills. Make connections. Get hired."
  - "Workshops, networking, competitions — straight to careers."
  - "Real experience. Real employers. Real results."

### Text Hierarchy Standardization
- **Main Headline**: "Our Members Get Hired!" (large, bold, neon green)
- **Supporting Text**: All four lines use consistent `text-base` and `text-slate-300` styling
- **Rationale**: Uniform readability and professional appearance
- **Visual Impact**: Clear hierarchy with prominent main message

### Responsive Design
