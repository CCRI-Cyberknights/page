        Recently, members of the <span class="emphasis-text">CCRI Cyber Club</span> had the opportunity to join the <span class="emphasis-text">CrowdStrike x NCL Fall Workshop</span> — and it was easily one of the most valuable events of the semester. The session, hosted by <span class="emphasis-text">CrowdStrike university recruiter Melanie</span>, brought together students from across the National Cyber League (NCL) community to talk resumes, interviews, and career growth in the cybersecurity industry.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-slate-200 mb-4">
        From the start, the energy was great. Melanie and several CrowdStrike team members — representing <span class="emphasis-text">incident response, threat hunting, intelligence, and red teaming</span> — joined the call to give students hands-on career advice in specialized breakout rooms. It wasn't your typical "career talk" either; it was a deep dive into how to actually <em>land</em> cybersecurity roles and internships with real-world relevance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Career Prep, the CrowdStrike Way</h2>
      
      <p class="text-slate-200 mb-4">
        The workshop focused heavily on <span class="emphasis-text">resume and interview preparation</span>, which fits perfectly with the Cyber Club's mission to prepare students for their cybersecurity careers. Each breakout room was tailored to a specific career path, so whether you're into red teaming, forensics, or threat intel, you could get <span class="emphasis-text">targeted advice directly from professionals</span> in that field.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-slate-200 mb-4">
        Melanie also broke down the <span class="emphasis-text">CrowdStrike internship programs</span>, including their <span class="emphasis-text">12-week summer internships</span> and the <span class="emphasis-text">Launch program</span> designed for freshmen and sophomores. Both offer hands-on experience, mentorship, and a look into CrowdStrike's world of digital defense. She even mentioned how CrowdStrike's early interns are often trained with the goal of being hired full-time — something every student was excited to hear.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">CrowdStrike Career Opportunities</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-200 mb-3">
          For students interested in pursuing opportunities with CrowdStrike, the company offers positions across multiple domains:

      <h2 class="section-title">Why NCL Matters More Than Ever</h2>
      
      <p class="text-slate-200 mb-4">
        One of the biggest takeaways was how much <span class="emphasis-text">CrowdStrike values NCL participation</span>. Since CrowdStrike uses <span class="emphasis-text">Cyber Skyline</span> — the same platform NCL runs on — students who compete in NCL already have a head start. Melanie encouraged everyone to <span class="emphasis-text">list NCL experience on their resumes</span>, emphasizing that employers notice when students are gaining real, hands-on practice through competitions.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-slate-200 mb-4">
        That validation is huge for us at CCRI, since NCL is one of our club's cornerstone activities. It's motivating to know that the skills we sharpen through competitions are directly relevant to major cybersecurity employers.
      </p>
      
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3 class="subsection-title">NCL and Cyber Skyline Connection</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-200 mb-3">
          The National Cyber League (NCL) uses the Cyber Skyline platform for their competitions, which is the same platform CrowdStrike uses for technical assessments. This means:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-200 space-y-2">
          <li>NCL participants are already familiar with the platform used in industry</li>
          <li>Competition skills directly translate to job interview scenarios</li>
          <li>Employers recognize NCL experience as valuable hands-on practice</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="section-title">Industry Insight and Inspiration</h2>
      
      <p class="text-slate-200 mb-4">
        Beyond career prep, the workshop gave us a deeper look into <span class="emphasis-text">CrowdStrike's company culture</span>. We learned about the company's origins, its focus on intelligence-driven defense, and its global presence. The CrowdStrike team talked about their <span class="emphasis-text">Falcon platform</span>, their emphasis on research, and how they continue to innovate to stay ahead of modern threats.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-slate-200 mb-4">
        The recruiters also shared practical insights about <span class="emphasis-text">technical assessments</span> — for instance, that many of their cybersecurity internship evaluations are done through Cyber Skyline. For anyone preparing to apply, that tip alone made the session worth it!
